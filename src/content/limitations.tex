\section{Limitations and Future Work}\label{sec:limitations}
\myparab{Engineering complexity.} Fully fused, persistent kernels demand deep GPU + distributed-systems expertise;
future work may investigate compiler/DSL abstractions to lower this barrier.

\myparab{FP16 inefficiency.} Our FP16 path is suboptimal (\S\ref{sec:fp16-memory-throughput})
due to insufficient tuning.
We anticipate addressing this gap with autotuned GEMM operators like cuBLASDx~\cite{cudx} or
CUTLASS builders.

\myparab{Training support.} This work targets inference;
enabling training will require fusing backward computation and gradient communication with new bookkeeping and
task descriptors.
